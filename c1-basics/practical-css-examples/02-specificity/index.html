      If there are two or more conflicting CSS rules that point to the same
      element, the browser follows some rules to determine which one is most
      specific and therefore wins out. Think of specificity as a score/rank that
      determines which style declarations are ultimately applied to an element.
      The universal selector (*) has low specificity, while ID selectors are
      highly specific!
    </p>
    <h2>Calculating specificity (a smart points system):</h2>
    <ul id="my-list">
      <li>
        In-line style attribute is worth 1000 points (as seen in 01, it
        overwrites anything)
      </li>
      <li>Each ID is worth 100 points</li>
      <li>Each attribute, class or pseudo-class is worth 10 points</li>
      <li>Each element name or pseudo-element is worth 1 point</li>
      <li>
        In case of equality, the last value assigned (in the stylesheet) will be
        assigned
      </li>
      <li>* (the global selector) has no value</li>
      <li>Combinators, like +, ~, > have no value</li>
    </ul>
